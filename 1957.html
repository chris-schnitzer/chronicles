  <p>The fifties was the real start of big wave surfing, almost the same level that we see today. At a time when surfers thought it was impossible, the charge was pioneered by John Kelly, Rabbit Kekai, Woody Brown and Greg Noll. In 1957 Greg Noll became the first surfer to ride Waimea Bay on the North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii which is an iconic big wave spot that hosts the invitational Eddie Aikau event at present.
