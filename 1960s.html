  <p>The 1960s saw the rise of surf culture with surf shops popping up all over the coasts of the USA. Boardshorts and bikinis arrived. The Beach Boys formed in 1961 and sang all about the culture. Hollywood jumped on the bandwagon by making surf films such as "Surfing Hollow Day" in 1961 and the classic "Endless Summer" in 1966.</p>
