  <p>Surf films were taken to new heights in the early 90s as a new crew of futuristic talent moved on to the scene. One of those was young Kelly Slater. Taylor Steele made the "Momentum 1" surf film in 1992 which featured the likes of Kelly Slater, Ross Williams, Taylor Knox, Rob Machado, Donovan Frankenreiter and Benji Wetherly. It was a new era in surf films with no narrative or interviews, just surfing and punk rock music. Taylor Steele went on to make many more successful films.</p>
