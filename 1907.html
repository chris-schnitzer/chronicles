  <p>George Freeth moves from Hawaii to California. He is believed to be the first non-native Hawaiian to surf. His relocation to California introduces the sport of surfing to the West Coast and later on to the East Coast with the help of Duke Kahanamoku. Freeth is also recognised as being the first professional surfer and innovator experimenting with new board designs. He appeared in a Californian railway company commercial to promote their services.</p>
