  <p>In 1912 Duke Kahanamoku took surfing from the Hawaiian islands to the East Coast of mainland America. In 1914 and early 1915 he introduced surfing to Australia and New Zealand. Duke is one of the all time world greats of surfing. As the sport was in decline he was one of the guys who helped revive it. He is a skilled surfer as well as a swimming Olympic gold medalist. Being such a famous surfer, ironically he had financial hardship unlike the modern greats today.</p>
