  <h5 class="modal_caption">Simon Anderson talks about the Thruster</h5>
  <p>The biggest innovation in surfboard technology was invented by Simon Anderson when he created the three fin surfboard or the thruster which still remains the most popular choice today. He designed the thruster surfboard as he needed an edge over his competitors especially Mark Richards and his twin fin surfboard. He needed a surfboard that would work well in the world tour stops that were being visited at the time such as England, Japan and Brazil which offered poor small conditions.</p>
